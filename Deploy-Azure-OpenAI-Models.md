# Deploy Azure OpenAI Models

Welcome to Contoso Corporation's AI exploration lab! In this exercise, you'll embark on a journey to integrate Azure OpenAI into your workflow.

### Estimated Time: 30 Minutes

## Lab Scenario
 
 Contoso Corporation, an innovator in engineering practices, has embraced the dynamic duo of Microsoft Azure and OpenAI. In this exercise, you'll delve into creating a deployment and model using the Azure AI Foundry portal.
  
## Lab Objective

In this exercise, you will perform the following:
- Deploy Azure OpenAI Model.
- Deploy a model

## Task 1: Deploy Azure OpenAI Model.

In this task, you will deploy an Azure OpenAI model by setting up an instance, configuring resources, and making the model ready for use in Azure.

1. In the **Azure portal**, search for **Azure OpenAI (1)** and select **Azure OpenAI (2)**.

1. On the **Basics** tab of **Create Azure OpenAI** page enter the following settings:
   
    - **Subscription**: Default-Pre-assigned subscription. **(1)**
    - **Resource group**: sql-chat-gpt-<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false"></inject> **(2)**
    - **Region**: Sweden Central **(3)**
    - **Name**: OpenAI-<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false"></inject> **(4)**
    - **Pricing tier**: Standard S0 **(5)**
    -  Click **Next** (6)
  
         ![](images/sql-3.png)
      
         >**Note:** Kindly select Sweden Central region only as the resources are region-specific.

4. Keep the rest as default, click on **Next twice** and subsequently click on **Create**.

5. Wait for deployment to complete. Then go to the deployed Azure OpenAI resource in the Azure portal.

    > **Congratulations** on completing the task! Now, it's time to validate it. Here are the steps:
   - If you receive a success message, you can proceed to the next task.
   - If not, carefully read the error message and retry the step, following the instructions in the lab guide.

### Task 2: Deploy a model

Azure OpenAI provides a web-based portal named **Azure AI Foundry portal**, which you can use to deploy, manage, and explore models. You'll start your exploration of Azure OpenAI by using the Azure AI Foundry portal to deploy a model.

1. In the **Azure portal**, search for **Azure OpenAI (1)** and select **Azure OpenAI (2)**.

   ![](images/21-06-25-p-1.png)

1. On **Microsoft Foundry | Azure OpenAI** blade, select **OpenAI-<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false"></inject>**

   ![](images/im-02-2.png)

1. In the Azure OpenAI resource pane, click on **Go to Foundry portal** it will navigate to **Foundry portal**.

   ![](images/im-03.png)
  
1. On the **Microsoft Foundry** page, click on **Deployments (1)** from the left naviagtion pane, select the **+ Deploy model (2)** drop down and then click on **Deploy base model (3)**

   > **Note**: Click on the **Expand** button, if you don't see the left side navigation pane.

   ![](images/code2-2.png "Keys and Endpoints")             

1. On the **Select a model** page, search and select **gpt-4.1-mini (1)** and click on **Confirm (2).**

   ![](images/im-05.png "Create a new deployment")

1. On the **Deploy gpt-4.1-mini** pop-up interface, click on **Customize**
   
   ![](images/im-06.png "Create a new deployment")

   > **Note**: If you dont see the **Customize** option you can go ahead with next step.

1. Within the **Deploy gpt-4.1-mini** pop-up interface, enter the following details and then click on **Deploy (8)** button to deploy a model that you will be playing around with as you proceed.
     
    - **Deployment name**: gpt-4.1-mini **(1)**
    - **Deployment Type**: Standard **(2)**
    - **Model version upgrade policy**: Upgrade once new default version becomes available **(3)**
    - **Model version**: 2025-04-14 (Default) **(4)**
    - **Tokens per Minute Rate Limit (thousands)**: 250K **(5)**
    - **Content Filter**: Default **(6)**
    -  **Enable Dynamic Quota**: Enabled **(7)**

         > **Note:** Azure OpenAI includes multiple models, each optimized for a different balance of capabilities and performance. In this exercise, you'll use the **gpt-4.1-mini** model, which is a good general model for summarizing and generating natural language and code. For more information about the available models in Azure OpenAI, see [Models](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/openai/concepts/models) in the Azure OpenAI documentation.

# Azure OpenAI + NLP using ChatGPT on SQL Engine

### Overall Estimated Duration: 4 Hours 

## Overview

In this lab, you will explore an application that combines Azure OpenAI’s ChatGPT with advanced data analytics to deliver actionable business insights. The solution uses AI to identify trends, analyze customer behavior, and forecast outcomes, enabling data-driven decision-making. You will also gain practical experience with Azure App Services for scalable hosting and Azure OpenAI for natural language processing, transforming complex data into meaningful intelligence.

## Objective

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- **Open AI Setup and Installation of Application**: Learn to review and configure an OpenAI resource in Azure, followed by deploying an application to Azure App Service using the command-line interface. This exercise will cover setting up the resource, ensuring its proper integration, and successfully hosting the application in the cloud.

- **Quick Start With Hosted Demo Application**: Learn to interact with the hosted Demo Application, utilizing the Data Analysis Assistant and SQL Query Writing Assistant. This exercise focuses on analyzing data and leveraging AI tools to streamline data analysis and query generation.

## Pre-requisites

- **Fundamental Knowledge of Azure Services**: Knowing about some of the basic services like App Services.

- **Basic Understanding of Programming Language**: basic understanding of programming languages like python or csharp.

## Architecture

In this hands-on lab, you will deploy a Python or C# web application to Azure App Services via the CLI and integrate it with an Azure OpenAI resource. The application features two tools: the Data Analysis Assistant, which uses AI to uncover insights and trends from data, and the SQL Query Writing Assistant, which helps users generate and optimize SQL queries from natural language inputs. You will configure the application to handle user requests, leveraging Azure OpenAI to deliver intelligent, data-driven responses and query support.
